Rebuilding this bio. Meanwhile, some unrequested curiosities about me: <br>
-I love craft beer and collect the caps.<br>
-My playlist ranges from 90s pagode (this only brazilians relate, sorry, but think in terms of paradox) to Machine Head. <br>
-As a child, I wanted to be Indiana Jones. <br>

Yeah... This is not looking good. Hope git can forgive my absence; I'm coming back this year.

<!-- EN: Hi, how are you? Here I'm building my journey in development. <br> I am a Social Scientist in career transition and Front-End student at Laboratória. <br>
👩🏽‍💻 It's been quite a journey: a new day, a new challenge, but never boredom (that's what I love about technology).
💪🏼 I am very curious and love to learn, which gives me proactivity and responsibility for my learning process. I also like to work as a team, discuss solutions and see everyone helping each other and growing together.
📚 What I'm learning today: JavaScript, React, CSS, UX and UI. 

Random facts about me (you didn't ask):
1. I love craft beer - stout and irish red ale - and I collect its caps.
2. My playlist goes from Destiny's Child to Machine Head.
3. As a child, I wanted to be an archaeologist and live the adventures of Indiana Jones.
